# Embedding Programs as Fenced Code Blocks

```mary-def
testBlock() -> ['Para "Hello" 'Space ['Strong "World"]]
testInline() -> ['Emph "blether"]
```

`<input type=text name="foo">`{=html}

```mary-eval
testBlock()
```

Perhaps this will achieve some `testInline()`{.mary-eval}.

`<input type=submit>`{=html}
