What number am I thinking of? `number`{.input}

`Submit answers and essay`{.input type=submit}


## Using the inputs

```mary
greet()
```

```mary
numberGame('field(concat("num","ber")))
```

```mary-def
concat(x, y) -> "`x``y`"

greet() -> ['Para "Hello " 'field("name") "! You are on page " 'param("page")]
numberGame(guess) ->
  ['Para "Wrong, the right number was "
         primNumToString(primNumAdd(primStringToNum(guess),1))
         ". Better luck next time!"]
```
