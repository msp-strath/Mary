# Displaying Forms


Name: `name`{.input type=text size=12}

What number am I thinking of? `number`{.input}

This is what I did during my summer holiday:
```{.input}
essay
```

`Submit answers and essay`{.input type=submit}

Here is a form which is being submitted empty: `empty`{.input type=text size=1}

## Using the inputs

```mary-eval
greet()
```

```mary-eval
numberGame('POST(concat("num","ber")))
```

```mary-def
concat(x, y) -> "`x``y`"

greet() -> ['Para "Hello " 'POST("name") "! You are on page " 'GET("page")]
numberGame(guess) ->
  ['Para "Wrong, the right number was "
         primNumToString(primStringToNum(guess) + 1)
         ". Better luck next time!"]
```
