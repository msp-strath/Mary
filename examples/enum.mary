This is a nested enumeration with concatenated sublists as
intermediate items.

```mary-eval
test()
```

It was generated using the following code:

``` { .mary-def .keep }
map(f, [])     -> []
map(f, [x|xs]) -> [f(x)|map(f, xs)]

enum(xs@[_|_]) -> [['Plain primStringConcat(xs)] ['BulletList|map(enum,xs)]]
enum(xs)       -> [['Plain xs]]

test() -> ['Div ["Enums" []|[]]|enum(["A" [["b" "c"] "d"]])]
```
