This is a nested enumeration with concatenated sublists as
intermediate items.

```mary
test()
```

It was generated using the following program `test()`:

``` { .mary-def .keep }
map(f, [])     -> []
map(f, [x|xs]) -> [f(x)|map(f, xs)]

enum(['Node|xs]) -> [['Plain primStringConcat(xs)] ['BulletList|map(enum,xs)]]
enum(xs)         -> [['Plain xs]]

test() -> ['Div "Enums" [] []
          |enum(['Node "A" ['Node ['Node "b" "c"] "d"]])]
```
